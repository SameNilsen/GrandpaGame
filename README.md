This is a game where you have this old fisherman who fishes fish and throws them at enemies. I have made all the characters and backgrounds myself. You may be impressed.
At first you have this map where you have to select where to go:

Then you load into this stage where you are attacked by boars and you have to go to the water to fish so that you get something to throw at them. Oh and you get these goldducks as currency for killing an enemy:

I also for some reason wanted to make a platform gamemode, but i didnt finish it. It works kinda, but there is no gameplay other than jumping around:
